get all possible moves for that piece (*probability for 1-4) -- expand out tree
do for all pieces

- turn states/moves(??) into nodes in tree
- recursively call to it for x amount of turns (depth of tree)
- apply expectiminimax algorithm to find best turn given probability

ID's
p1 squares = 0,1,2,3,4,5
middle = 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13
p2 squares = 14,15,16,17,18,19

*****
- working on movePiece so that if "spot" is equal to -1 then the piece will return to "home" spot

- $("#p"+piece.id).appendTo(document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0]); sends piece back to home row, not exact location though.

- for Piece class, change "color" to team?


state array is an array of all the board spaces, a space being a div element

- make game board fully functional -- pieces go to correct spots on correct sides of board
- add gameOver global variable -- check if either player has successfully moved all pieces off the board and won
- add pieceSafe (0-1) parameter for neural network? -- ex: if there is an enemy piece 2 spaces behind our piece
  in the "danger" zone, value: .5?

pseudo code for hover method

mouseHover(n, bool){
  if(checkLocation(hoverLocation, team)){    ///gives us a true or false if piece can move

  }

}
*old*
ERROR found:
pieces in middle call getSpace at line 460 with (piece.location && piece.team)
in middle row team == 3 and getSpace is failing to get the space I believe

-- fix getMoves() to properly work when AI is trying to move to scoring piece (14)
@will -- settings page could maybe have a mute audio option, play vs. CPU or player, etc.
