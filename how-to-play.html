        <h3>START</h3>
        <div>
            The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls four dice shaped as triangular pyramids.
            <br>
            <br>
            For each painted point facing up of a dice rolled, adds to how many spaces are given to move whichever piece they like.
            <br>
            <br>
            The player then chooses which piece to move.
        </div> 
        <h3>MOVEMENT</h3>
        <div>
            The player can only move to a space if...
            <ul>
                <li>A space is not occupied</li>
                <li>A space is occupied by an opponent and is not a rossette</li>
            </ul>
        
            If the piece is moved to a rossette space, the player gets another roll.
            <br>
            <br>
            When a player moves to a space that is occupied by the opponent, the opponent's piece is then moved back to the starting position. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If a player can not move, or the player rolled a 0, their turn is over.
            <br>
            <br>
            The direction in which the pieces move can be seen below
